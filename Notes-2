An invariant is something that does not change when we apply the rules ot a problem
Strategy to solve invariant problems:
1)identify what is unknown about the final state and what is known
2)introduce variables to represent the state
3)Model the process of filling boxes
4)Identify an invariant
5)Combine the previous steps to deduce the final state


Proposition - Statements which are either True or False
Axiom - Propositions which are True by definition
Theorem - Propositions which can be proved to be True
