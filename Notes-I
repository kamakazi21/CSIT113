All problems have: A start state, A current state, A goal state, operators and contraints
A problem exists when there is a gap between the current state and the goal state.
Well defined problem - all states are explicitly given
Ill defined problem - states are not explicitly given
Knowledge Rich Problems - Rerquires Prior Knowledge
Knowledge Poor Problems - Does not rerquire Prior Knowledge
Polyas Methold:
-Understand the problem: Make sure you understand what the problem is asking.
-Plan a strategy for solving the problem.
-Execute your strategy, and revise it if necessary.
-Check and interpret your result
An algorithm is a systematic dscription of how to solve  problem
An algorith should be finite,complete,correct and precise
An algorithm should be efficient and general
The efficiency of an algorithm cna be expressed in terms of its complexity
Time complexity•Space complexity•Communication complexity
The lower bound complexity for an algorithm to solve a particular problem is the complexity of that problem
Algorithms can be categorised by the domain to which they apply
Algorithms can be categorised by the approach which they apply
How to create algorithm:
-Solve the problme
-Write down the steps to solve the problem
Problem Solving strategies:
-Analogy
-Reduction
-Research
-Abstratcion
-Solve a Simpler Problem
Think about how you solved a problem after you solved it.
